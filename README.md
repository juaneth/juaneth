## Programming languages

- C# -- I started learning C# with winforms with my project [EmuArk](https://github.com/juaneth/EmuArk) and it was pretty crap, but I learnt more about C# and winforms over months and I learnt some handy tricks to make easy UI's, although I felt like I wasn't making anything
- JS -- Just recently I started learning JS, HTML and CSS to use with Electron, a framework to make Desktop apps using HTML and NodeJS and I started out with converting a Discord Bot over to an Electron Dashboard
