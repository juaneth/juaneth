# Juaneth
Hey I'm Juan, a UK-based JS/NodeJS dev and UI Designer, I have knowledge of React, Express, Tailwind CSS, plain HTML/JS/CSS, Electron and React Native for mobile apps.

[bot.dev](https://github.com/juaneth/bot.dev) and [NuRem](https://github.com/juaneth/NuRem) are my main projects right now

## Commisions
I charge by hour $4.50 and usually websites/electron apps only take 2-3 hours, and big projects can take up to 30 hours. I prefer PayPal but I'll accept other payment services. Only time spent actively working is counted.

DM me on Discord here with your ideas and requirements: juaneth#9008
