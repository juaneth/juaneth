# About me
## Languages

 - C#
      - I learnt C# by learning winforms, I learnt it all over the summer in 2020 and I got the fundamentals of programming down. I'm most proud of [QSM](https://github.com/juaneth/QSM), this project was the most complex and challenging things I made and im so proud of it. Even though it is pretty primitive and riddled with mistakes
 - HTML/CSS
     - I started learning HTML when I started working on my dad's work's website [TimeChart](https://github.com/juaneth/TimeChart), this also taught me CSS and it was very surprisingly easy! I had the website looking good in under 5 hours and I am still working on it to this day. I'd like to believe I know lots of HTML and CSS although google and stack overflow are still my best friend
 - JS
     - I learnt JS by working on [monkeyman](https://github.com/juaneth/monkeyman-discord) with my friend [@Ohmeg](https://github.com/Ohmeg), this also started with me learning the Electron framework. I disliked how hard it was to make something good looking in C# and how good looking and easy everything was to make in HTML/CSS really attrcated me to Electron.
